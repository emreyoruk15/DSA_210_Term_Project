# EV Adoption Analysis
# Project Proposal
# Motivation
Electric Vehicles (EVs) are becoming an essential part of the transition to sustainable transportation. Understanding the factors influencing EV adoption can help policymakers, businesses, and consumers make informed decisions. This project aims to analyze global EV adoption trends and explore key influencing factors such as fuel prices and charging infrastructure.
# Datasets
•	Sales of EVs: I will examine the EV sale numbers for the last few decades
•	Charging Stations: The number of charging stations compared to years will be examined
•	Fuel prices: I will examine how fuel prices changed over the years
# Data Sources
This project will use publicly available datasets on EV adoption and enhance them with additional datasets to explore correlations with external factors. Mainly, the International Energy Agency website and their datasets will be used to gather data.
