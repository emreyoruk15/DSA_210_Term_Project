# DSA_210_Term_Project EV Adoption Analysis

# Project Proposal

# Motivation
Electric Vehicles (EVs) are becoming an essential part of the transition to sustainable transportation. Understanding the factors influencing EV adoption can help policymakers, businesses, and consumers make informed decisions. This project aims to analyze global EV adoption trends and explore key influencing factors such as fuel prices and charging infrastructure.

# Datasets
-	**Sales of EVs**: I will examine the EV sale numbers for the last few decades
-	**Charging Stations**: The number of charging stations compared to years will be examined
-	**Fuel prices**: I will examine how fuel prices changed over the years
  

# Plan
**Data Collection**
- Data will be collected from publicly avaible datesets such as:
  - International Energy Agency
  - U.S. Departmant of Energy

**Data Preparation**
- Data will be cleaned and analyzed to ensure consistency
- The dataset will be examined for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to maintain data integrity
- Enrichment datasets will be merged to provide additional insights into EV adoption trends

**Data Visualization and Analysis**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Trends will be identified using statistical methods and visualization techniques
- Mostly graphs will be used to visualize data such as:
  - Sales of EVs vs Years
  - Charging Stations vs Years
  - Fuel Price vs Years
